A good workaround is to write Markdown in Jupyter notebooks and share the `.ipynb` files on GitHub, since everything inside is usually rendered properly. However, it is easier to take notes on a local text editor such as VSCode with Markdown support, becuase it automatically generates and updates the table of content, and you don't have to run a notebook server to take notes.\n", "\n", "# Usage\n", "`md2nb.py` finds all `.md` files in the current working directory and port them into `.ipynb` files with a single Markdown block.\n", "```bash\n", "$ python md2nb.py\n", "```\n", "\n", "# Reference\n", "- [How to Publish an Open-Source Python Package to PyPI](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/)\n", "- [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)\n"]  }
