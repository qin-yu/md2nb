        "Taking notes using Markdown makes it easier for sharing on GitHub, but GitHub doesn't display Latex-style mathematics in `.md` files. A good workaround is to write Markdown in Jupyter notebooks and share the `.ipynb` files on GitHub, since everything inside is usually rendered properly. However, it is easier to take notes on a local text editor such as VSCode with Markdown support, becuase it automatically generates and updates the table of content, and you don't have to run a notebook server to take notes.\n",

        "This package is quite simple. But the author decided to make it a package because of the encouraging [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIF3LaRqgXo) by Mark Smith at EuroPython 2019.\n",

        "# Usage\n",
        "`md2nb.py` finds all `.md` files in the current working directory and port them into `.ipynb` files with a single Markdown block.\n",
