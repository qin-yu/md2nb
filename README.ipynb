        "Taking notes using Markdown makes it easier for sharing on GitHub, but GitHub doesn't display Latex-style mathematics in `.md` files. A good workaround is to write Markdown in Jupyter notebooks and share the `.ipynb` files on GitHub, since everything inside is usually rendered properly. However, it is easier to take notes on a local text editor such as VSCode with Markdown support, becuase it automatically generates and updates the table of content, and you don't have to run a notebook server to take notes.\n",

        "This package is quite simple. But the author decided to make it a package because of the encouraging [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIF3LaRqgXo) by Mark Smith at EuroPython 2019.\n",

        "# Installation\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "$ # install using:\n",
        "$ python -m pip install md2nb\n",
        "$\n",
        "$ # to verify installation and show help:\n",
        "$ md2nb\n",

        "# Usage\n",
        "The simplest example - in the root directory of this repo:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "$ md2nb --dir . -r\n",
        "Converting '.md' files within ./ and all subdirectories:\n",
        "\t./README.md\n",
        "\t./test/example.md\n",
        "\t./test/example-gB18030.md\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two recommended ways of using `md2nb`:\n",
        "1. `md2nb` converts all files with `--ext` specified extensions in the `--dir` specified directories into `.ipynb` files with a single Markdown block. For example:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    # to convert all Markdown and text files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories\n",
        "    $ md2nb --dir . -r --ext .md .txt\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "2. `md2nb` converts all files identified by their file paths. For example:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    # to convert all Markdown files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories\n",
        "    $ md2nb *.md -r\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "3. In fact, these two ways can be combined. For example:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    # to convert README, LICENSE, all .md and .txt files in . and ./doc/\n",
        "    $ md2nb README LICENSE --dir . doc --ext .md .txt\n",
        "    ```\n"
